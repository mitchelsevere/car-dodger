## Initial thoughts on game structure
* Want game to increase in speed as time progresses
* Collision detection working on cars
* Want car to move side to side on keypress
* After collision, display time score
* Make cars randomly appear on screen

## Phases of Completion
1. Design
* Creating the container with the road and adding car sprites

2. Animation
* Create animation of the street lines to create movement

3. Difficulty
* Create cars on screens randomly
* Have the speed increase as time progresses

4. Display 
* Display how long the player has lasted

## Links and Resources
> None so far. HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS for now.
